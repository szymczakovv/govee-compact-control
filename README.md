# App to Control Govee LED Strips

This application is designed as a part of the "OwnDeck" project, with its core functionality (e.g., turning the lights on/off) integrated into the `pystry` module for taskbar control. In the future, it will be fully combined with the "OwnDeck" ecosystem, enhancing its feature set and usability.

## Features

- **Control your Govee LED Strips**: Power on/off and basic operations.
- **Integrated with `pystry`**: Taskbar-level control for seamless access.
- **Designed for Expandability**: Will eventually be part of the "OwnDeck" smart home platform.

## Finding Your Govee Device's IP Address

To locate the local IP address of your Govee device, you can use tools like [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/pl/).

## Status

This project is **no longer under active development**, but contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and modify it as needed.

### Notes for Future Development

The app currently serves as a foundation for more advanced smart home integrations. Future contributions could include:
- Adding support for additional Govee features like color adjustments.
- Expanding integration with "OwnDeck" for more robust automation.
- Mobile or web-based interfaces for remote control.
